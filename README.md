Hello, I'm @geoyousling, the Head of Business Development for Gaming at Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs is a digital asset and blockchain content company with 60k NFT holders with a combined onchain value of $15Bn.
We're bulding culture on the blockchain — shaping web3 through storytelling, experiences, and community. Currently, I support our digital metatverse (Otherside) which offers an array of different worlds and mini-games — as well as our recenlty launched free-to-play mobile title (DDU) available across the Apple App Store, Google Play, Mac, and PC. 

I'm a partnerships & sales leader with a proven track record of 14+ years helping F500 brands, high growth startups, and agencies develop revenue driving initiatives. 
Grateful to have been part of two rocket ships, Wildfire and Adyen, one as an early team member helping to scale growth from 60 employees to 400+ employees and a $420MM acquisition by Google — the other expanding US enterprise partnerships with some of the largest brands in B2B, tech, gaming, and retail — contributing to Europe's largest tech IPO of 2018.

I live in the Pacific Northwest and enjoy spending time outside with my energetic two young boys and amazing wife. We love to find new trails, explore the beach, and play golf together!
